        <h3> SPEED HISTORY</h3>

            <h3>The Journey Behind Speed Web Solutions</h3>
            <p>
                <h3>Q1 2022, A Life on the Edge</h3>
                <p>John Mwangi, a 27-year-old IT graduate from Nairobi, had just lost everything.

After graduating in 2020 with dreams of becoming a successful software developer, John faced a harsh reality: no job, no money, no connections. The post-pandemic economy was unforgiving, and most companies had frozen hiring. He resorted to manning a cyber café during the day and doing odd tech gigs at night — formatting laptops, unlocking phones, or troubleshooting printers.

But even those jobs weren't enough to keep up with rent. By March 2022, John was evicted, forced to sleep in the backroom of the cyber café he once worked at. Hunger, shame, and hopelessness clouded his days.</p>

            <h3> Q2 2022, A Spark of an Idea</h3>
            <p>
                One evening in May 2022, a small business owner visited the cyber to complain — his website was “too slow” and customers were leaving. John, curious, asked if he could try fixing it. In 2 hours, he compressed images, minified JavaScript, and activated simple caching.

To everyone's surprise, the site’s speed doubled — and the customer’s traffic increased.

That moment sparked something in John:

    “What if I help others with slow websites gain back their customers?”

He began researching website speed optimization, often skipping meals but never skipping learning. He used public Wi-Fi to watch tutorials, read case studies, and test online tools like PageSpeed Insights.

            <h3>Q3 2022, The Foundation of Speed Web Solutions</h3>
            <p>
                By August, John registered a domain using borrowed money:
SpeedWeb.co.ke

He started offering services on social media and freelancer platforms — mostly to small businesses, churches, and schools with slow, underperforming websites.

The first few clients were skeptical. After all, he had no office, no company registration, and no portfolio. But John offered one thing:

    “If I don’t improve your site speed by at least 50%, you don’t pay.”

That offer worked.

By September 2022, he had optimized over 15 websites, all for minimal pay, but rich testimonials.

            <h3>Q4 2022, The Breakthrough</h3>
            <p>
                In November 2022, John’s big break came when a Kenyan online retailer hired him to speed up their e-commerce platform.

He delivered — improving their load time from 11 seconds to under 3 seconds. Their sales jumped by 18% in just two weeks.

The retailer featured him in a LinkedIn post. That post went viral.

In December, he registered Speed Web Solutions officially as a business. He moved out of the backroom and into a shared workspace.

    From homelessness to hosting clients.

                <h3>Q1 2023, Building the Mission</h3>
                <p>
                    Now with stability, John began shaping his vision.

He didn’t just want to offer a service. He wanted to create a solution for others like him — youths with IT knowledge but no jobs.

He launched the Speed Web Skills Bootcamp, a 3-month training program where he taught others how to optimize websites, work with clients, and earn online.

By March 2023, 12 trainees had completed the program — 6 of them had already landed their first freelance gigs.

                <h3>Q2 2023, Expanding the Dream</h3>
                <p>
                    Speed Web Solutions now served clients in Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda. John hired 3 of his best students to join his team.

The company offered:

    Website speed optimization

    Mobile-first redesigns

    SEO consultation

    Website audits

But John didn’t forget his roots. Every month, he offered free optimization services to 1 struggling youth-led business.

                <h3>Q3 2023, Facing New Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    With growth came pressure.

    More clients meant more work.

    Some clients failed to pay.

    Hosting costs increased.

At one point, the company was nearly shut down due to a server crash. But John’s team worked overnight to restore services.

He realized the need for better systems — automation, backups, proper contracts.

By the end of Q3, he invested in cloud infrastructure and created simple web tools to automate speed testing and diagnostics.

                <h3>Q4 2023, Recognition & Growth</h3>
                <p>
                    In November, Speed Web Solutions was shortlisted for a Tech Innovation Award by a regional youth digital forum.

John was invited to speak at events, where he often said:

    “I didn’t build a company to make money. I built it to help people get back what I once lost — opportunity.”

He started a mentorship group called “Speed Circle” for youth interested in digital entrepreneurship.

                <h3>Q1 2024 to Present, Stability and Vision</h3>
                <p>
                    As of now, Speed Web Solutions is:

    Serving over 200 clients

    Training new cohorts every 4 months

    Partnering with universities to upskill graduates

    Launching a mobile app for site monitoring

John is no longer sleeping in cyber cafés. He’s mentoring others, hosting webinars, and building a legacy.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    John Mwangi’s story is proof that:

    Your lowest moment can become your launching pad.

Website speed optimization wasn’t just a service. It became a bridge between hopelessness and hope — both for himself and for others like him.

Speed Web Solutions is not just a tech company; it's a movement, born from struggle, powered by knowledge, and driven by the desire to uplift.
